## Electronic EPROM programmer

The EPROMs programmer circuit proposed in this Electronic article is designed to flash 
EPROMs memories (read-only memory whose contents can be erased by ultraviolet light 
or other means and reprogrammed using a pulsed voltage) such as the memory chip SMT27C256B from Texas instrument.

The chip SMT27C256B is composed of 256K bit electrically Programmable Read Only Memory (EPROM).  
The device is organized as 32K words by 8 bits  (32K  bytes). 

The version 1.0 will be compatible only the chip SMT27C256B (256M-Bytes) however, the version 2.0 will
allow larger chip such as the SMT27C512 to be recognized during the boot sequence with their mannufacturer and 
product code. 

The  TMS27C512  series  are  65 536  by  8-bit(524 288-bit),   
ultraviolet (UV) light erasable, electrically programmable read-only  memories.

The version 3.0 (still on the drawing board) is desgined with the famous 8-bit microprocessor Zilog Z80 
microprocessor to allow the recognition of many type of EPROM memories.
